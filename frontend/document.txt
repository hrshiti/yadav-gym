✅ FRONTEND MASTER PLAN (Website + Web App)
Tech Stack

React.js (Vite or Next.js – recommended: Next.js for routing + SEO + SSR)

Tailwind CSS

Framer Motion → UI component animations

GSAP → complex timeline animations, page transitions

Lenis → smooth scrolling

Recharts / Chart.js → graphs (progress, attendance, performance)

React Query → API caching + smooth loading UI

Socket.io-client → real-time chat

Zustand / Redux Toolkit → app state management

🌟 1) GLOBAL UI/UX DESIGN SYSTEM

Text Dark:         #1F2937
Text Light:        #6B7280
Success:           #22C55E
Danger:            #EF4444
